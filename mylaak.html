                For this university project, we were challeneged to work in groups using the scrum method, for a real
                life client.
                <br><br>
                My group were lucky enough to work with the GemeenteArchief Den Haag. The archive wanted to engage with
                the Laakquartier community and and represent them in the archive of today for the generations of
                tomorrow.
                <br><br>
                The problem statement they posed to us was:
                <br><br>
                How can we capture the identity of Laak and it’s inhabitants as it is now, with modern day digital
                means? How do we present and archive this, making it futureproof so people living a
                100 years from now can look back and know about Laak in 2022?

                Our initial researched showed Laak to be a particularly multicultural area of the Hague predominaantly
                occupied by people under the age of 40. We wanted to design a concept which engaged with this fairly
                young demographic both digitally and physically, whilst remaining accessible to older generations too.
                <br><br>
                We decided on creating a digital community which enables people to share their stories, photos,
                favourite places, music etc reomtely. This would enable the GemeenteArchief to retain a digital record
                of residents life in real time digitally, future-proofed for years to come.
                <br><br>
                Initially we set about designing a website and app, which would enable users to submit their
                contributions to the campain remotely.
                <br><br>
                The main event of the project was the LaakWall- a giant touchscreen interface placed in a pulic space,
                such as in Holland Spoor train station. This would act as an advertisment and showcase of the campain
                and all of its contributors to the general public.
                <br><br>

                After initial user testing with members of the public, and consultation with the Archeif we realised a more localised approach was needed. Laak is not only diverse, it’s also large, with it’s own neighbourhoods and subcommunities within and the project needed to reflect that.
                <br><br>
                As a result, a pop up kiosk was designed to work in combination with the wall and online presence. This acts as a satellite to the main campaign and is moveable, so can be placed in various neighbourhoods over the period of the campaign. 
                <br><br>
                The kiosk is designed to display and collect neighbourhood specific information on a microcomminity level. 
                <br><br>
                The entire digital interface of the wall was developed, adding extra security measures for users, simplifiying the UI and ensuring consistency from platform to platform.

                The final prototype was designed to be simple, intuative and engaging for the user. We wanted the uploading of a ‘story’ to be as quick and easy as possible. In our final prototype it is possible within just a few clicks. Additionally, each element (the wall, kiosk, site) displays QR codes so anyone with a smartphone can scan and share almost instantly.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, as SCRUM was a new method of working for me there were a few good takeaways I got from the methodology:
                <br><br>
                -investing time in team meetings is extremely important and ultimately saves time in the long run
                <br><br>
                -not every detail needs planned in advance, sometimes you just have to go for it!
                <br><br>
                -always be ready to be experiment and adapt
