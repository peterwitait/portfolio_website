                This project was part of my minor ‘the next successful online startup’. We were challanged with creating
                a viable online startup business over a number of months. Research was conducted on macro, meso and
                micro levels, as well as marketing and financial plans created.
                <br><br>
                The concept was a digital gallery and marketplace for new, student artists to showcase and sell their
                work, earn some money and gain greater exposure.

                In order to identify potential customers’ needs research was conducted via desk research, interviews and
                surveys over a number of weeks. with art students. teachers and potential art buyers.
                <br><br>
                Interviews were split into three categories: art students, art buyers, and people who do not buy art in
                order to analyze their individual habits, preferences, and struggles, and how we might address them when
                building our business model. To reach as many potential users a survey was used, of which there were an
                impressive 91 responses.
                <br><br>
                Further to this we conducted extensive market research and competitor analysis before moving forward.
                <br><br>
                Once all data was collected and analysed, an initial business model canvas and user personas were
                created, which can be seen below.

                From the research it was clear that both buyers and artists wanted an intensly visual experience when
                using the site, with clear, to the point information and the ability to contact customer service to
                enquire about a piece before buying. Using this information wireframes were produced.
                <br><br>
                The concept was to make the experience as visually stimulating as possible for the user, while
                maintaining a clean, modern look with a punch.

                A high fidelity fully clickable prototype website was then produced and hosted using webflow. This was
                my first time using the programme so it was a rather steep learning curve! The site is designed to be
                vibrant and eyecatching, without being overwhelming for the user,

                In order to test the viability of the project,, a facebook and instagram page were set up and an
                advertisement campaign was launched. This ran for two weeks on both platforms with half the posts
                targeting artists who may wish to sell, and the second half targeting potential art buyers, encouraging
                them to sign up to our newsletter for further updates and to register interest.
                <br><br>
                By then end of the two weeks we had reached a total of 1,516 people with a total of 68 sign ups.

            <p>
                <br>
                This project was a big leraning curve from start to finish. Undertaking various forms of analysis honed my research skills and designing and producing the site itself vastly improved my understanding of UI development.
                <br><br>
                In the end the feedback from users about the business and it’s digital digital design was very positive. Also the final number of sign ups was extremely encouraging, proving that there certainly was interest in the project within the Netherlands to make it viable.
