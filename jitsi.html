                The first wave of the corona pandemic brought about new challeneges in daily life, and many took to
                technology in new ways to be together apart. As a result, as part of my degree in UX design I was
                challenged with redesigning Jitsi, a video conferencing platform to meet the needs of new and evolving
                digital subculture.
                <br><br>
                I chose to remodel Jitsi into a digital space for hosting and participating in online clubnights.

            <p>
                <br>
                Research was carried out remotely through desk research, interviews with online partiers and DJs in the
                UK, Netherlands and US, observations and active participation in online clubnights and raves. I wanted
                to find out:
                <br><br>
                - how online parties organised the interactive experience digitally <br>
                - how the interface compensated for the lack of physical closeness <br>
                - what drives users to participate in these events <br>
                <br>
                After conducting my research I analysed my data and came to the following key insights to consider:
                <br><br>
                - users relish variety and expect the unexpected <br>
                - users get off on entertaining others and making them feel connected <br>
                - users are thick skinned but cannot stand intolerance <br>
                <br>
                I compiled my findings into a user persona to help guide the ideation process.

                Once the users’ needs were analysed I ideated upon them using various diverging methods such as
                sketching and brainstorming. I also invited some of my interviewees to take part in a digital
                brainwriting and collage making excercise to gain a fuller understanding of what the final product
                should be.
                <br><br>
                Then I converged my findings down into defined points through further analysis and clustering, before
                creating a simple interactive wireframe prototype. to be tested on potential users.
                <br><br>
                After conducting a number of user tests I made alterations before moving onto the high-fi interactive
                prototype below:

            <p>
                The final result is a platform which aims to mimic the real life interactions and spaces found in a
                physical club digitally. Users are free to roam different rooms and chat with the constant flow of
                fellow partiers that float along their screen. They can interact with each other on different levels,
                from a wink to then offering a drink, and from chatting on the dancefloor to one-on-one conversations at
                their ‘table’.
                <br><br>
                Users are also able to express themselves and entertain others through a choice of dynamic backgrounds
                and effects that display within their window.
                <br><br>
                Security was one of the main users needs and this was satisfied by implementing a three level distancing
                system to block, ignore or report users for unacceptable behaviour. This is available to any user from
                any page within a few clicks, providing that they can see the user or are interacting with them.
